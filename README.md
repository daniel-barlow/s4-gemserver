# The Simple S3 Gemserver

This gem provides the command `s4g-upload`, which uploads a folder
full of gems into an S3 bucket and creates/updates the appropriate
metadata to allow Bundler to use the bucket as a gem source.

The motivation is that you can build your private gems on a CI server
and then upload them into a private S3 bucket.

## Installation

    $ gem install s4-gemserver

## Usage

`s4g-upload` expects the environment variables AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY to be set correctly, and the bucket to exist.
Run it with

    $ s4g-upload --create name-of-my-bucket path/to/my/gem-repo # first time
    $ s4g-upload name-of-my-bucket path/to/my/gem-repo # subsequent times

`path/to/my/gem-repo` should name a directory containing a
subdirectory called `gems`, which holds all the gems you wish to
upload.  `s4g-upload` will

* download, update and re-upload the "specs" files that bundler
expects to find
* upload the new gems.

If it cannot find the specs and you have not specified `--create` it will
assume that something has gone wrong, and stop.
